In the last months, a lot of things happened. We *know* people are expecting the new release, but please be a bit more patient, it's on its way!
Today I wrote this post in order to announce two things:

## New members

First, [@sdroege] and [@antoyo] are now official members of [gtk-rs], congratulations to them!

 * [@sdroege] is behind a lot of the recent changes in the [glib] crate and made a lot of other contributions as well. He's also the owner of the [gstreamer] bindings in Rust.
 * [@antoyo] is the creator of the [relm] crate and also the one who wrote the bindings for [webkit2gtk-rs].

They're both extraordinary contributors to the GNOME environment in Rust and it's a real honor for me to be able to work with them!

## New crates

When joining us, [@antoyo] also added the following crates:

 * [javascriptcore-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/javascriptcore-rs)
 * [webkit2gtk-rs]
 * [webkit2gtk-webextension-rs](https://github.com/gtk-rs/webkit2gtk-webextension-rs)

We intend to release a version on [crates.io](https://crates.io) as soon as possible (but it won't be the new release for all other [gtk-rs] crates!).

## Conclusion

That's it for the big news. We're still working really hard for the next [gtk-rs] release. There will be breaking changes so it'll be a major release.

Until then, Rust well!
