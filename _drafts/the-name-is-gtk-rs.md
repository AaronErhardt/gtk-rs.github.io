Welcome to the Gtk-rs[^name] website! This site is going to be the place to get
news about breaking changes and development progress. We will post
building instructions, examples, best practices and crates documentation.

[^name]:
    What's with all the different names?

    When transitioning from a personal repo ("rgtk") the GitHub
    organization was named "rust-gnome". Alas, since we're not a part of GNOME,
    it's not appropriate for us to use that name.

We're starting small though, with just an introduction and a blog. Everyone
is welcome to help us improve both the content and the design of this site by
opening PRs against the [rgtk.github.io] repo.

[rgtk.github.io]: https://github.com/rgtk/rgtk.github.io
