# Contact

For general support use the GNOME Discourse or the Matrix chat.

- GNOME Discourse **[discourse.gnome.org](https://discourse.gnome.org)**
- Matrix channel **[#rust:gnome.org](https://matrix.to/#/#rust:gnome.org)**

### Contact Gtk-rs developers

If you want to contact the Gtk-rs developers directly, there are multiple ways, either you can go on matrix as shown above or you can also just open an issue on our [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/gtk-rs). However, please keep in mind that issues on GitHub should be used for bug reports or feature requests and not for general support.
