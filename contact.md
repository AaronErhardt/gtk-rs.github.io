### Contact gtk-rs developers

If you want to contact the *gtk-rs* developers directly, there are multiple ways, either you can go on matrix as shown above or you can also just open an issue on our [repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/gtk-rs). However, please keep in mind that issues on GitHub should be used for bug reports or feature requests and not for general support.
